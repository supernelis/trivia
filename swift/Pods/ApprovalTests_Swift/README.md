ApprovalTests
====

Capturing Human Intelligence - ApprovalTests is an open source assertion/verification library to aid unit testing.

ApprovalsTest Swift is compatible with the XCUnit testing framework

What can it be used for?
---

Approval Tests can be used for verifying objects that require more than a simple assert.

How to get it
---
CocoaPods
```
target 'MyApp' do
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for MyApp 

  target 'MyAppTests' do
    inherit! :search_paths
    # Pods for testing
    pod 'ApprovalTests_Swift', :git => 'https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Swift.git'
  end

end

```

Examples
---
[Sample Code](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Swift/blob/master/ApprovalTests.SwiftTests/Demo/SampleArrayTest.swift)
```Swift
class SampleTest: XCTestCase {

    	func testList() throws {
        	var names: [String] = ["Llewellyn", "James", "Dan", "Jason", "Katrina"]
        	names.sort()
        	try Approvals.verifyAll("", names);
    	}
}
```
Will Produce a File

    SampleTest.testList.received.txt
    [0] = Dan
    [1] = James
    [2] = Jason
    [3] = Katrina
    [4] = Llewellyn

Simply rename this to SampleTest.testList.approved.txt and the test will now pass.


Approved File Artifacts
---

The `*.approved.*` files must be checked into source your source control. ApprovalTests now ignores line endings by default (so you can remove `*.approved.* binary` from your .gitattributes file if you added previously).

If you would like to verify line endings, simply add `[assembly: IgnoreLineEndingsAttribute(false)]` to your AssemblyInfo.cs

Do not add `*.received.*` files to your source control (they are transitory, and some SCMs like TFS will lock them or mark them read-only, which will break every dependent test).
